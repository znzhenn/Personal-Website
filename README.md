# Website Learning
Compilation of my progress as I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


# Goals
- Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarize myself with website layouts
- Build an interactive personal website


# Process
I began this project without any prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself. Starting the same way that anyone would, I typed "how to build a website" into YouTube and searched for a tutorial that would help to give me the basic rundown. 

Using [I built a Website in 10 Minutes using HTML & CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VegDvRLVlOI&t=1s) by Brian Design. Even with the tutorial, it took me around an hour to complete the same project as I slowed the video down to understand what each section of code was doing on my screen. For example, the HTML was easily understood, as it was simply creating a structured document delineated by tags. CSS was used to style the layout of web pages, but it required me to access a specific part of the document. I designed my own logo, added a line underneath the nav bar, and altered the color of the site to better understand the effect that each element might have on a user attempting to use the page. However, this was just a page. If you clicked anything on the nav bar, it would simply reload the page. There was nothing to this website beyond the page, and I was not satisifed. Understanding that JS was required to make pages interactive, I began to research how to implement it. After some time, I was able to make the button on the left column interactive, first making it alert the user when clicked, and  now intentionally reloading the page, but this was all I was able to implement at this time. I looked up tutorials, researched, and even scoured the source code of various websites but other than the button, I didn't know what I was supposed to write in the JS file. I ran into several issues with replit itself, where replit would show a message saying that the page wasn't running at this time.

At this point, I had a basic understanding of how to make a page, but no real way to take it further, and I stepped away from the project as I reevaluated my goals. While I still fully intend to make a personal website, a more realistic understanding for me was that today was not going to be the day that I mastered it, and that was okay. Instead, I made it my focus to simply learn as much as I was able to within the next 5 hours. 

My next resource was a [Parallax Scrolling Website | How to Make a Website using HTML CSS  & JavaScrip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfeqDyMUx4) by Online Tutorials. Having gained a basic understanding of how a web page was built, following along with this tutorial was much easier as I was better able to understand exactly which piece of code was doing. I learned the importance of images on a website in capturing audience attention, and improving the overall aesthetic of the page my selecting a palette of colors. There was a lot of frustration in the process when I made a mistake because the entire page would look wonky, and it took a moment of reviewing the code to understand what I had done incorrectly. Further, the video was able to teach me that even if some of the code was right previously, when adding another element, one should consider the steps needed to make the entire page cohesive. Sometimes, that does mean going back and adding a few more lines to what you had thought was done. The explore button on the page will scroll this user to the section below it.

After the tutorial, I added a "Projects" section as well as a "Contact Info" section to better evaluate my learning. By editing and adding to the code, I was able to take what I had learned from both videos and gain practice with new concepts. 

This is not at all a complete project, but it is a stepping stone as I look to create more and better things in the future.


# Learning
- Understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
- The importance of responsive design principles in creating a better user experience
- Debugging a website when an element doesn't respond correctly
- Proper documentation of code, and naming references
- I am incredibly capable of coding a website, and given more time I will do so


# Future Goals
To create an effective personal website that the user is able to interact with.
